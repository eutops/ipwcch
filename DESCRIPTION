Version: 0.1.0
Author: Charlotte D. Vavourakis
Maintainer: Charlotte D. Vavourakis <charlottevavourakis@gmail.com>
Description: 
    Provides statistical tools for evaluating prognostic biomarkers in prospective case-cohort study designs. 
    Designed for survival outcomes and dynamic prediction in epidemiologic or clinical research settings.
    Supports time-dependent ROC curve analysis and AUC with CI estimation using inverse probability weighting, accounting for possible competing events. 
    Censoring is assumed to be administrative; inverse probability weighting for censoring is not currently implemented.
    This package includes also plotting helper function to vizualize estimates of absolute and relative risks over time assessed with other packages.
