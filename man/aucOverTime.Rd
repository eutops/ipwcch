\title{Calculate AUC Over Time with Confidence Intervals}
\usage{
aucOverTime(
  dat,
  times,
  marker,
  event_code = "1",
  eps = 0,
  n_boot = 1000,
  seed = 42
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame with the same structure required by `weightedRoc()` and `aucWithCI()`, including:
- `entry`: Entry time into risk set
- `exit`: Exit time (event or censoring time)
- `to`: Event type or status code
- `weight`: Inverse probability or sampling weight
- `marker`: A continuous risk score or biomarker column}

\item{times}{A numeric vector of time points at which AUC should be calculated.}

\item{marker}{Character string naming the column in `dat` containing the marker/risk score.}

\item{event_code}{Character or numeric value specifying the event of interest (default = "1").}

\item{eps}{Numeric buffer applied in the combining step of `weightedRoc()` to handle
near-censoring at `tmax` (default = 0.0). See `weightedRoc()` for details.}

\item{n_boot}{Number of bootstrap resamples used to estimate the confidence interval (default = 1000).}

\item{seed}{Integer value used to set the random seed for reproducibility (default = 42).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{t_eval}: The evaluated time points at which AUC was calculated.
  \item \code{AUC}: The calculated Area Under the Curve for each time point.
  \item \code{CI_lower}: The lower bound of the confidence interval for the AUC.
  \item \code{CI_upper}: The upper bound of the confidence interval for the AUC.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for a given biomarker over specified time points,
along with the corresponding confidence intervals using nonparametric bootstrapping in weighted case-cohort designs with adminstrative censoring.
}
\details{
This function depends on `weightedRoc()` and `aucWithCI()` to compute the AUC with CI for survival data with censoring and weights.

This function iterates over the specified time points and calculates the AUC for each point,
along with the 95% confidence interval using bootstrapping.
If there are no individuals at risk at a particular time point, that time point is skipped, and a warning is issued.

For weighted case-cohort designts, it is assumed `dat` includes appropriate inverse probability sample weights.
Weights should have been assigned, for this may use this package function `assignWeightsCch()`.

  to = sample(c(0, 1), 30, replace = TRUE), # event indicator 0/1
