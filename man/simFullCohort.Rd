\title{Simulate a Full Cohort with Competing Risks}
\usage{
simFullCohort(
  n = 1000,
  lambda1 = 8e-04,
  lambda2 = 3e-04,
  meanX = 0,
  sdX = 1,
  censoring = c("administrative", "informative"),
  Tmax = NULL,
  censor.rate = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Number of individuals to simulate. Default is 1000.}

\item{lambda1}{Numeric. Baseline hazard rate for cause 1. Default is 0.0008.}

\item{lambda2}{Numeric. Baseline hazard rate for cause 2. Default is 0.0003.}

\item{meanX}{Numeric. Mean of the normally distributed covariate \code{X}. Default is 0.}

\item{sdX}{Numeric. Standard deviation of the covariate \code{X}. Default is 1.}

\item{censoring}{Character. Type of censoring: either \code{"administrative"} or \code{"informative"}.}

\item{Tmax}{Numeric. Maximum follow-up time for administrative censoring. Must be provided if \code{censoring = "administrative"}.}

\item{censor.rate}{Numeric. Rate parameter for exponential censoring times under informative censoring. Must be provided if \code{censoring = "informative"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{id}{Individual ID}
  \item{time}{Observed time (either event or censoring time)}
  \item{status}{Event indicator: 0 = censored, 1 = cause 1, 2 = cause 2}
  \item{X}{Covariate value}
}
}
\description{
This function generates a synthetic dataset simulating a full cohort with competing risks, incorporating
a continuous covariate and allowing for either administrative or informative censoring.
}
\details{
This function simulates two competing event times:
\itemize{
  \item \code{T1} from an exponential distribution with a rate that increases with covariate \code{X}.
  \item \code{T2} from an exponential distribution with a rate that decreases with covariate \code{X}.
}
The observed event time \code{T} is the minimum of the two, and the event cause is determined accordingly.

Depending on the \code{censoring} argument, censoring times are applied either:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Administratively:} All individuals are followed up to a common time point \code{Tmax}.
  \item \strong{Informatively:} Each individual is assigned a censoring time drawn from an exponential distribution with rate \code{censor.rate}.
}
The observed time is the minimum of the event and censoring time, and status indicates the cause of the event (1 or 2) or 0 for censoring.

# Administrative censoring example
df_admin <- simFullCohort(n = 1000, Tmax = 10, censoring = "administrative")

# Informative censoring example
df_info <- simFullCohort(n = 1000, censor.rate = 0.001, censoring = "informative")
