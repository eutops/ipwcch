\title{Compute AUC with Confidence Interval via Bootstrapping}
\usage{
aucWithCI(
  dat,
  t_eval,
  marker,
  event_code = "1",
  eps = 0,
  n_boot = 1000,
  seed = 42
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame with the same structure required by `weightedRoc()`, including:
- `entry`: Entry time into risk set
- `exit`: Exit time (event or censoring time)
- `to`: Event type or status code
- `weight`: Inverse probability or sampling weight
- `marker`: A continuous risk score or biomarker column}

\item{t_eval}{Numeric value for the time point at which AUC is evaluated.}

\item{marker}{Character string naming the column in `dat` containing the marker/risk score.}

\item{event_code}{Character or numeric value specifying the event of interest (default = "1").}

\item{eps}{Numeric buffer applied in the combining step of `weightedRoc()` to handle
near-censoring at `tmax` (default = 0.0). See `weightedRoc()` for details.}

\item{n_boot}{Number of bootstrap resamples used to estimate the confidence interval (default = 1000).}

\item{seed}{Integer value used to set the random seed for reproducibility (default = 42).}
}
\value{
A list with following components:
\itemize{
  \item AUC: The observed AUC at time `t_eval` on the original data.
  \item CI_lower: Lower bound of the 95% bootstrap percentile confidence interval.
  \item CI_upper: Upper bound of the 95% bootstrap percentile confidence interval.
  \item AUC_bootstrap: Vector of AUC values from bootstrap replicates (after removing NAs).
  \item t_eval: The evaluation time at which the AUC was computed.
  \item n_boot: Number of successful bootstrap samples (after removing any with errors).
}
}
\description{
Estimates the area under the weighted ROC curve (AUC) at a specified time point `t_eval`
along with a 95% confidence interval using nonparametric bootstrapping.
}
\details{
This function depends on `weightedRoc()` to compute the AUC for survival data with censoring and weights,
and supports designs such as case-cohort via optional weighting.


Bootstrap resampling is done by drawing rows with replacement from `dat`.
For weighted case-cohort designts, this assumes `dat` includes appropriate inverse probability sample weights.
Weights should have been assigned, for this may use this package function `assignWeightsCch()`.

If a bootstrap sample results in no events or non-events (causing AUC computation to fail),
the result is skipped (NA removed).
