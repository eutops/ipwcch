\title{Combine CoxPH Hazard Estimates with Exit Times}
\usage{
mixin12(coxphData, exitTime)
}
\arguments{
\item{coxphData}{A `data.frame` containing:
- `time`: time points at which cumulative hazards are estimated
- `hazard`: corresponding cumulative hazard values}

\item{exitTime}{A numeric vector of exit or transition times for all observed states.}
}
\value{
A `data.frame` with:
  - `time`: unique sorted time points from both `coxphData$time` and `exitTime`
  - `hazard`: cumulative hazard values at each time point, with missing ones filled by LOCF
}
\description{
This function merges a cumulative hazard function (from a `coxph` model) with
a vector of event or exit times (from a multi-state model), filling in missing
hazard values via last observation carried forward (LOCF).
}
\details{
This is typically used to prepare cumulative hazard data for use in
transition probability calculations (e.g., with `msfit`).

\examples{
# Example with dummy data
cox_data <- data.frame(time = c(1, 3, 5), hazard = c(0.1, 0.4, 0.9))
exit_times <- c(2, 4, 5, 6)
mixin12(cox_data, exit_times)
